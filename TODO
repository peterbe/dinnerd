TODO
====

  for printing.

* Ability to upload and store pictures.

* Consider using runInAction() when updating the store with multiple things.

* Figure how a way
  1) encourage saving to Home screen on first run
  2) if someone uses IndexedDB in safari and THEN later decide to add
to Home screen, all data is lost.

* Ideas for how to style print.css
https://www.tinyprints.com/shop/custom-menus.htm

* Consider js-search since it supports incrementally adding documents
  apparently

DONE
====

* Upload burger logo on http://realfavicongenerator.net/
