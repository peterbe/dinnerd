* Experiment with:
appcache-manifest "build/index.{html,css,js}" "build/**/*.{css,js}"
"build/burger.png" --network-star -o build/index.appcache

* Convert URLs to titles using
  http://tools.buzzstream.com/meta-tag-extractor
  or http://embed.ly/docs/explore/extract?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FAPI%2FPage_Visibility_API


* Try https://github.com/BafS/Gutenberg

* Consider using runInAction() when updating the store with multiple things.

* Figure how a way
  1) encourage saving to Home screen on first run
  2) if someone uses IndexedDB in safari and THEN later decide to add
to Home screen, all data is lost.

* Ideas for how to style print.css
https://www.tinyprints.com/shop/custom-menus.htm

* Consider js-search since it supports incrementally adding documents
  apparently

DONE
====
